## 🎯 Philosophy

V3 is built around the same guiding principles as V2, now extended to **multimodal workflows**:

- **Clarity over clutter** – a clean interface for both image and audio pipelines  
- **Modularity over chaos** – structured Subgraphs keep everything organized  
- **Full control without sacrificing usability** – tweak every parameter in image, speech, or music generation  

Whether you're producing quick visual concepts, recording speech, or composing AI-generated music,  
V3 provides a **stable, scalable, and professional foundation** for multimodal creation.

**V3 – Clean. Modular. Powerful. Multimodal.**
